The user wants to open Claude Code in a new tab. This seems to be a request about how to use Cursor or access Claude Code functionality. Let me help them understand how to do this.

Claude Code is typically accessed through Cursor's interface. In Cursor, you can:
1. Use the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)
2. Look for Claude-related commands

However, I should clarify what exactly they mean by "Claude Code in a new tab" - they might be referring to:
1. Opening a new chat/conversation with Claude in a new tab
2. Opening Claude Code as a separate application or terminal
3. Something else entirely

Let me provide them with helpful information about how to access Claude in Cursor.</details></think>

---

To open Claude Code in a new tab in Cursor, you have a few options:

1. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) to open a new AI chat tab

2. **Command Palette**: 
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "New AI Chat" or "Claude" and select the option to open a new chat

3. **Click the + icon**: In the Cursor sidebar where you see the chat panel, look for a "+" or "New Chat" button to open a fresh conversation tab

4. **Right-click on a tab**: You can also right-click on an existing chat tab and select "Duplicate" or open in a new tab

If you're looking to run **Claude Code CLI** (the terminal-based Claude tool) in a new terminal tab, you can:

```bash
claude
```

Just open a new terminal tab in Cursor (`Cmd+Shift+`` ` or through Terminal > New Terminal) and run the `claude` command if you have it installed.

Which specific option were you looking for?

Permission issue. Let's try with `sudo`:

<tool-use data-tool-type="shell" data-tool-name="run_terminal_cmd">
<details><summary>Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd** • Run command: sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code</summary>

```bash

```
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required

The terminal doesn't have access to prompt for a password. Let me suggest the user run this command manually in their terminal, or we can try using npx to run it without global installation.</details></think>

---

The command needs your password which I can't enter. You have two options:

**Option 1: Run manually in your terminal**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
Enter your password when prompted, then run `claude` to start.

**Option 2: Use npx (no installation needed)**

It seems like it's still loading or there might be an issue with npx. This is taking a while because it might be downloading the package first. Let me try checking if maybe the terminal is just buffering output or if there's an issue.

Actually, this is running in the background. The user should be able to see it in their terminal tab #2. Let me let them know to check that terminal.</details></think>

---

Claude Code is starting in **Terminal 2**. It's downloading/initializing - this may take a moment on the first run.

Check the terminal tab labeled "2" in your Cursor IDE's terminal panel. You should see Claude Code loading there. If it's taking too long, you can also try running it manually:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Or for a permanent installation, run this in your external terminal (iTerm/Terminal.app) where you can enter your password:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude
```
